## Coding game 🎮

### What is this 🤔?

[Coding game](https://codinggame.com) is online multiplayer coding platform . Coding game has a different type of approach to competetive coding by combining coding with gaming (👨‍💻 + 🕹).

It has various competetions and events happening all the time .My favourite event is the [Clash of code ](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode). Bot programming is another great activity where you code a bot with the given constrains and try to achieve a desired result as you compete with your opponents and ace the leaderboard

## [Coding escape 🏃‍♂️💨](https://escape.codingame.com/)

This is another exciting game made by the coding game community. As on this date of writing this article this game is still in beta .The most exciting part of the game is the concept itself.
It is like an online escape room where you along with your friends solve riddles and puzzles to win . The best part of this is the game can also be played with non-coders (most of my friends 😑)
